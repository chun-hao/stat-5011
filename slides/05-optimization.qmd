## Recap of the Last Lecture

{{< include macro.qmd >}}

-   An $L$-layer FCNN (the $L$th layer is the output layer) can be written recursively as
    $$
    f^{(L)}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \boldsymbol{W}^{(L)}\boldsymbol{h}^{(L-1)} +  \boldsymbol{b}^{(L)} \in \R^k,
    $$
    where
    $$
    \boldsymbol{h}^{(l)} = \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}^{(l)} \boldsymbol{h}^{(l-1)} + \boldsymbol{b}^{(l)}\right), \quad l = 1, \ldots, L-1,
    $$
    and $\boldsymbol{h}^{(0)} = \boldsymbol{x} \in \R^p$.
-   We use a link function to connect the predictor $f^{(L)}(\boldsymbol{x})$ to the conditional expectation $\E(Y \mid \boldsymbol{x})$.  
-   The parameters of the model can be learning by minimizing the empirical risk using the **gradient descent algorithm**.
-   The gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters can be computed using the **back-propagation**.
-   In practice, all the gradients computations are done automatically, for example, using `torch.autograd`. 

## Deep Neural Networks

-   Neural network is a very flexible and powerful class of models; there are many ways to design them:
    -   Depth (number of hidden layers)
    -   Width (number of hidden units)
    -   Activation functions
    -   Optimization (learning rate and learning schedule)
    -   Regularization
-   It is impossible for us to know the best architecture for a given problem in advance. Typically, we monitor the learning process and adjust the architectures accordingly.
-   Numerous experiments have shown that **deep but narrow networks** are more efficient than **shallow but wide networks**.
-   However, training deep networks is challenging due to various reasons and we will discuss some strategies to address these challenges.

## Deep vs Shallow Networks

-   Using the same number of nodes (parameters), deep networks can represent more complex functions than shallow networks:
    -   Shallow network (one hidden layer): **linear combination** of simple nonlinear functions
    -   Deep networks (multiple hidden layers): **functional composition** of simple nonlinear functions
-   Earlier layers capture primitive features, and later layers capture more complex features.

## Challenges of Training Deep Networks

-   Deeper networks are often harder to train, and are also unstable to parameter initialization or hyperparameter choices.
-   The main reason is that the loss function is high dimensional and highly non-convex, due to the recursive composition of nonlinear functions.
-   The loss function loos like:

## Challenges of Training Deep Networks

-   The challenges of training deep networks include:
    -   Complicated loss landscape (local minima, saddle points, flat regions, cliffs, etc)
    -   Vanishing and exploding gradients
    -   Convergence (the convergence rate slows down exponentially with depth)
-   Next, we will discuss some special architectures and optimization strategies to address these challenges. 

## Local Minima

-   In convex optimization problem, it can be reduced to the problem of finding a local minimum, which is guaranteed to be the global minimum.
-   With nonconvex functions, such as neural nets, it is possible to have many local minima, which is due to the **model identifiability** problem.
-   For example, 
    -   **weight space symmetry (permutation symmetry)**: we can reorder the neurons in any hidden layer, along with the corresponding permutation of the weights and biases associated with them
    -   **scaling symmetry**: in any ReLU network, we can scale all the incoming weights and biases of a unit by $a$ and all its outgoing weights by $1/a$.
-   The parameters in neural networks are not interpretable and so is any unidentifiable models.
-   Thus it is not important to find a true global minimum rather than to find a point in parameter space that has low but not minimal cost, i.e., good local minima.

## Saddle Points and Flat Regions

-   These regions are where the gradient is close to zero, but not local minima:
    -   **Saddle points**: points where the gradient is zero but the Hessian has both positive and negative eigenvalues.
    -   **Flat regions**: regions where the gradient is close to zero but the Hessian has all eigenvalues near zero.
-   Gradient-based optimization algorithms can get stuck in these regions.

## Vanishing Gradients

-   The vanishing gradient problem is a common issue in training deep networks: the gradient in the earlier layers is close to zero.
-   This problem would lead to slow convergence or even the model cannot be trained.
-   Consider a deep network with $L$ layers, each layer with 1 node and no bias term.
-   Denote the weights of the $l$-th layer as $w_l$ and $h_l = \sigma(w_l h_{l-1})$.
-   The gradient of the loss $\ell$ with respect to $w_l$ is
    $$
    \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w_l} = \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial h_L} \cdot \frac{\partial h_L}{\partial h_{L-1}} \cdot \frac{\partial h_{L-1}}{\partial h_{L-2}} \cdots \frac{\partial h_{l+1}}{\partial h_{l}} \cdot \frac{\partial h_l}{\partial w_l}.
    $$
-   Note that $\frac{\partial h_l}{\partial h_{l-1}} = \sigma^{\prime}(w_l h_{l-1})w_{l}$ and hence
    \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w_l} & = \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial h_L} \cdot \frac{\partial h_L}{\partial h_{L-1}}  \cdots \frac{\partial h_{l+1}}{\partial h_{l}} \cdot \frac{\partial h_l}{\partial w_l} 
    = \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial h_L} \left(\prod_{i=l+1}^L w_i \right)\left(\prod_{i=l+1}^L \sigma^{\prime}(w_ih_{i-1})\right)\frac{\partial h_l}{\partial w_l}.
    \end{align*}
-   When $L$ is large and $\sigma^{\prime}(x) < 1$, the gradient $\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w_l}$ is close to zero.

## Cliffs and Exploding Gradients

-   Cliffs are regions where the gradient is very steep, which can cause the optimization algorithm to diverge.
-   This issue can be avoided by the **gradient clipping** method:
    -   **Value Clipping**: Each component of the gradient vector is individually clipped to lie within a predefined range, such as [-threshold, threshold].
    -   **Norm Clipping**: The entire gradient vector is scaled down if its norm (such as the L2 norm) exceeds the threshold, preserving its direction but reducing its magnitude.

# Depth-Friendly Architectures

## Activation Function Choice

The specific choice of activation function often has a considerable eﬀect on thes everity of the vanishing gradient problem. The following are the derivatives of some common activation functions:

## Dead Neurons

-   In recent years, the use of the sigmoid and the tanh activation functions has been increasingly replaced with the ReLU and the hard tanh functions.
-   The ReLU is faster to train because its gradient computation amounts to checking nonnegativity.
-   However the ReLU activation introduces a new problem of **dead neurons**: when a neuron has negative activation, it is dead.
-   The negative activation would happen for a couple of reasons:
    -   The weights are initialized to be negative
    -   The learning rate is too high
-   Once a neuron is dead, the weights of this neuron will never be updated further during training.
-   Some solutions are:
    -   Choose a modest learning rate 
    -   Use some variants of ReLU

## Variants of ReLU

There are several variants of ReLU that are designed to address the dying ReLU problem, for example,

-   **Leaky ReLU**: $f(x) = \max(\alpha x, x)$
-   **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)**: $f(x) = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x > 0, \\ \alpha(\exp(x) - 1) & \text{if } x \leq 0. \end{cases}$

:::

## Maxout Networks

-   The *maxout network* is proposed by Goodfellow et. al. (2013) to address the dying ReLU problem.
-   The maxout unit outputs $\max(W_1x + b_1, W_2x + b_2)$. 
-   It can be viewed as a generalization of the ReLU and the leaky ReLU:
    -   If $W_2 = 0$ and $b_2 = 0$, then it is the ReLU.
    -   If $W_2 = \alpha W_1$ and $b_2 = \alpha b_1$, then it is the leaky ReLU.
-   However, it does not saturate at all, and is linear almost everywhere. In spite of its linearity, it has been shown that maxout networks are universal function approximators. 
-   Maxout has advantages over the ReLU, and it enhances the performance of ensemble methods like Dropout.
-   However, one drawback with maxout is that it doubles the number of parameters.

## Skip connections

-   The skip connection is proposed by He et. al. (2016)[^resnet].
-   The idea is to reformulate the layers as **learning residual functions** with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions.
-   This is often called **residual learning**.

## Loss Landscape with Skip Connections

-   The ResNet-56 is a network proposed by He et. al. (2016), which has 56 layers and 0.85M parameters. 
-   With the skip connections, the loss function becomes much smoother and easier to optimize.

## Batch Normalization 

-   Batch normalization (BN) is a method to address the vanishing and exploding gradient problems.
-   The idea is simple: we normalize the output of a unit $i$ over a batch of training samples (substract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) and then scale and shift the result.
-   More specifically, let $x_{ij}$ be the output of $j$the sample in the $i$th unit. Then the BN layer computes
\begin{align*}
\mu_i & = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^m x_{ij}, \quad \sigma_i^2 = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^m (x_{ij} - \mu_i)^2, \\
\tilde{x}_{ij} & = \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_i}{\sigma_i}, \quad y_{ij} = \gamma_i \tilde{x}_{ij} + \beta_i
\end{align*}
where $\gamma_i$ and $\beta_i$ are learnable parameters.
-   There are two types of batch normalization:
    -   **post-activation BN**: normalize the output of the activation function
    -   **pre-activation BN**: normalize the input to the activation function
-   It is argued that the pre-activation BN is better than the post-activation BN.

## Benefits of Batch Normalization

-   Batch normalization has several benefits:
    -   It reduces the internal covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of the inputs to a layer.
    -   It acts as a regularizer, which reduces the need for dropout.
    -   It allows for higher learning rates, which accelerates the convergence.
    -   It makes the optimization more stable and less sensitive to the initialization.
-   A variant of batch normalization, known as **layer normalization**, is known to work well with recurrent networks.

# First-order Optimization Methods

## Recap of Gradient Descent

-   Given the loss function $J(\theta) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, f(x_i; \theta))$ of a neural network, the gradient descent algorithm updates the parameters as
    $$
    \theta^{(t+1)} = \theta^{(t)} - \eta \nabla J(\theta^{(t)}),
    $$
    where $\eta$ is the learning rate.
-   The gradient $\nabla J(\theta)$ can be computed using the back-propagation algorithm.
-   The learning rate $\eta$ is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned:
    -   If $\eta$ is too small, the convergence is slow.
    -   If $\eta$ is too large, the algorithm may diverge.
-   We will discuss some strategies to make the vanilla GD algorithm more efficient and friendly to deep networks:
    -   minibatch updates (using only a portion of the data to compute the gradient)
    -   momentum (accelerating the convergence)
    -   adaptive learning rate (adjusting the learning rate during training)


## Stochastic Gradient Descent

-   In most cases, the loss function is of the form $J(\theta) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, f(x_i; \theta))$,
    where $n$ is the number of samples and hence the gradient is
    $$
    \nabla J(\theta) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla \ell(y_i, f(x_i; \theta)).
    $$
-   The **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** algorithm updates the parameters using only one sample, i.e.,
    $$
    \theta^{(t+1)} = \theta^{(t)} - \eta \nabla \ell(y_i, f(x_i; \theta^{(t)}).
    $$
-   If the sample is drawn uniformly from the training samples, i.e., $I \sim \text{uniform}(\{1,2,\ldots, n\})$, the stochastic gradient is an unbiased estimate of the true gradient
$$
\E_I \left[\nabla \ell(y_I, f(x_I; \theta^{(t)})\right] = \sum_{i=1}^n \P(I = i)\nabla \ell(y_i, f(x_i; \theta)) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla \ell(y_i, f(x_i; \theta)) = \nabla J(\theta^{(t)})
$$
where the expectation is taking with respect to the sample index $I$.


## Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent

-   In practice, we randomly split the samples into minibatches (or simply batches) $\mathcal{B}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{B}_k$ each with size $m$.
-   The SGD upadtes the parameters when it sees a new batch and an **epoch** is completed when the algorithm has seen all the batches, i.e.,
    -   for $t = 1, \ldots, \text{num. of epoch}$:
        -   for $b = 1, \ldots, k$:
            -   $\boldsymbol{\theta} \leftarrow \boldsymbol{\theta} - \eta \cdot \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i\in \mathcal{B}_b} \nabla \ell(y_i, f(x_i; \boldsymbol{\theta}))$.

## Benefits of Using SGD

-   There are some benefits of using SGD:
    -   computational efficiency: the gradient is computed using a small batch of data (more frequent updates)
    -   The algorithm can potentially escape from local minima more easily since the gradient is noisier.
-   The SGD also introduces **implicit bias** since it is not moving towards the optimal direction (true gradient direction).
    -   Smaller batch size leads to more implicit bias.
-   This implicit bias is also related to the generalization performance [^SGDbias].

## Determining the Batch size

-   Larger batches provide a more accurate estimate of the gradient.
-   Computational limitations:
    -    Use smaller batch sizes if the model is large.
-   Small batches can oﬀer a regularizing eﬀect, due to the noise they add to the learning process.
-   However, training with such a small batch
size might require a small learning rate to maintain stability because of the high variance in the estimate of the gradient. 
-   Hence using smaller batch sizes can be computationally expensive.
-   Typically, the batch size is chosen to be a power of 2, e.g., 32, 64, 128, 256, etc.

## Variants of SGD

-   Due to the high dimensionality and non-convexity of the loss function, the vanilla SGD algorithm may not be efficient.
-   There are many variants of SGD that are designed to accelerate the convergence.
-   We will introduce three commonly used strategies:
    -   Learning Rate Schedules (gradually decreasing the learning rate)
    -   Momentum (accelerating the convergence)
    -   Adaptive Learning Rates (choosing the learning rate adaptively for each parameter)
-   These strategies often introduce additional hyperparameters that need to be tuned and can be combined with each other.
-   **Good**: we now have more optimization strategies to choose from.
-   **Bad**: there is no best optimization algorithm and we now have more hyperparameters to tune.
-   Typically, there will be some recommended default values for these hyperparameters.

## Learning Rate Schedules

-   The learning rate $\eta$ is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned and it greatly affects the convergence of the algorithm.
-   In practice, we often use a **learning rate schedule** to adjust the learning rate during training.
-   For example, in SGD, we use $\eta_t$ for the $t$-th epoch

![](images/lec05/sgd.png){fig-align="center" width=80%}

## Learning Rate Schedules

-   A suﬃcient condition to guarantee convergence of SGD is that
$$
\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \eta_t = \infty, \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \eta_t^2 < \infty.
$$
-   In practice, it is common to decay the learning rate linearly until iteration $\tau$:
$$
\eta_t = (1 − \alpha) \eta_0 + \eta_{\tau}
$$
with $\alpha = \frac{t}{\tau}$. After iteration $\tau$, it is common to leave constant.
-   The learning rate may be chosen by trial and error, but it is usually best to choose it by monitoring learning curves that plot the objective function as a function of time.

## Momentum-based Learning 

-   The method of momentum is designed to accelerate learning, especially in the face of high curvature, small but consistent gradients, or noisy gradients.

![](images/lec05/momentum.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}

## Standard Momentum

-   The standard momentum algorithm introduces a variable $\boldsymbol{v}$ that plays the role of velocity --- it is the direction and speed at which the parameters move through parameter space:
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{v} & \leftarrow \alpha \boldsymbol{v} - \eta \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}} \ell\left(f\left(x_i ; \boldsymbol{\theta}\right), y_i\right)\right) \\ 
\boldsymbol{\theta} &\leftarrow \boldsymbol{\theta} + \boldsymbol{v}
\end{align*}
-   Note that if the previous velocity is in the same direction as the current gradient, the update will be faster and vice versa.
-   Common values of $\alpha$ used in practice include 0.5, 0.9, and 0.99. Like the learning rate, $\alpha$ may also be adapted over time. 
-   Typically it begins with a small value and is later raised. Adapting $\alpha$ over time is less important than shrinking $\eta$ over time.

## Nesterov Momentum

-   The Nesterov momentum algorithm is a modification of the original momentum algorithm:
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{v} & \leftarrow \alpha \boldsymbol{v} - \eta \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}} \ell\left(f\left(x_i ; \boldsymbol{\theta} + \alpha \boldsymbol{v}\right), y_i\right)\right) \\ 
\boldsymbol{\theta} &\leftarrow \boldsymbol{\theta} + \boldsymbol{v}
\end{align*}
-   The key difference is that the gradient is evaluated at the point $\boldsymbol{\theta} + \alpha \boldsymbol{v}$ rather than at $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.
-   It can be shown that for gradient descent case, Nesterov momentum converges faster than the original momentum algorithm.


## Adaptive Learning Rates

-   The learning rate is one of the most diﬃcult to set hyperparameters because it significantly aﬀects model performance.
-   The loss is often highly sensitive to some directions in parameter space and insensitive to others.
-   Hence we can cause a separate learning rate for each
parameter and automatically adapt these learning rates throughout the course of learning.
-   The idea is simple: in the directions where the gradient is consistently small, we want to take larger steps and in the directions where the gradient is larger, we want to take smaller steps.
-   We will discuss some popular adaptive learning rate algorithms:
    -   AdaGrad
    -   RMSprop
    -   Adam

## AdaGrad

The AdaGrad algorithm individually adapts the learning
rates of all model parameters by scaling them inversely proportional to the square root of the sum of all the historical squared values of the gradient.

![](images/lec05/adagrad.png){fig-align="center" width=80%}


## RMSprop

The RMSProp algorithm modifies AdaGrad to perform better in
the nonconvex setting by changing the gradient accumulation into an *exponentially weighted moving average*.

![](images/lec05/rmsprop.png){fig-align="center" width=80%}

## Adam 

-   Adam = RMSProp + Momentum + Bias Correction

![](images/lec05/adam.png){fig-align="center" width=80%}

## Bias Correction

-   The velocity $\boldsymbol{v}$ is actually an estimate of the first moment of the gradient:
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{v}_t & = \rho_1 \boldsymbol{v}_{t-1} + (1-\rho_1)\boldsymbol{g}_{t} \\
& = \rho_1 \left(\rho_1 \boldsymbol{v}_{t-2} + (1-\rho_1)\boldsymbol{g}_{t-1}\right) + (1-\rho_1)\boldsymbol{g}_{t} \\
& = \rho_1^t \boldsymbol{v}_0 + (1-\rho_1)\sum_{i=1}^{t} \rho_1^{t-i}\boldsymbol{g}_i.
\end{align*}
-   Assuming $\boldsymbol{v}_0 = 0$ and taking the expectation, we have
\begin{align*}
\E[\boldsymbol{v}_t] & = (1-\rho_1)\sum_{i=1}^t\rho_1^{t-i}\E[\boldsymbol{g}_i] \stackrel{\textcolor{red}{(*)}}{=} (1-\rho_1)\cdot \frac{1-\rho_1^t}{1-\rho_1}\E[\boldsymbol{g}_t] = (1-\rho_1^t) \E[\boldsymbol{g}_t].\\
\end{align*}
-   The expectation is taken with respect to the randomness in the gradient, i.e., we view $\boldsymbol{g}_1, \ldots, \boldsymbol{g}_t \sim F$ as random vectors. The equality $\textcolor{red}{(*)}$ holds if the stochastic process $\boldsymbol{g}_1, \boldsymbol{g}_2, \ldots$ is stationary.
-   Hence the velocity is a biased estimate for $\E[\boldsymbol{g}_t]$ and an unbiased estimate for $\E[\boldsymbol{g}_t]$ is $\frac{\boldsymbol{v}_t}{1-\rho_1^t}$. 
-   The same argument applies to the second moment $\boldsymbol{r}_t$.




## Practical Recommendations

-   Training a deep neural network requires you to 
    -   choose a good architecture
    -   choose a good optimization algorithm
-   Both choices have many hyperparameters that need to be tuned and there is no one-fit-all solution.
-   For optimization algorithms, it is recommended to start with Adam or RMSProp using the default hyperparameters (for the momentum or decay rate).
-   If the model is not converging, try to reduce the learning rate or use a learning rate schedule.
-   All the algorithms have been implemented in popular deep learning libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, and you can use them directly without worrying about the details.
-   Next time, we will discuss some regularization techniques to improve the generalization performance of deep networks.
